# Mocha Reporter UI

Mocha Report UI is a tool which provides the ability to manage mocha unit test reports generated by popular mocha reporters, such as [mocha-jenkins-reporter](https://github.com/juhovh/mocha-jenkins-reporter), [mocha-junit-reporter](https://github.com/michaelleeallen/mocha-junit-reporter). The reporters generate xml format reports. Mocha Report UI consumes the files as data source and provides user friendly interface to display, analyse, and manage unit test reports.
